# Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
# They are defined using curly braces {} or the set() function
# Sets do not allow duplicate elements
# Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from them

e = set()  # empty set
# q = g()  # Will not create an empty set. To create an empty set, use set() function.
